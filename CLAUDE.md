# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the RisenOne Fire Analysis Agent - a production Google Cloud AI system using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) v1.0.0. It implements a multi-agent architecture for wildfire risk analysis and fire danger calculations for the Forest Service.

## Development Commands

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Initial setup (one-time)
./setup-risenone.sh        # Mac/Linux
./setup-risenone.ps1       # Windows PowerShell

# Activate environment before work
source activate_env.sh     # Mac/Linux
.\activate_env.ps1         # Windows
cd agent
```

### Common Development Tasks
```bash
# Install/update dependencies
poetry install

# Run tests
poetry run pytest tests/                    # All tests
poetry run pytest tests/ -k "test_fire_risk" # Specific tests
poetry run pytest -vv -s                    # Verbose output

# Start development server
adk web  # Visit http://localhost:8000

# Build deployment package
poetry build --format=wheel --output=deployment

# Deploy to production
cd deployment
python deploy.py --create
```

### Testing Fire Calculations
```bash
python test_nfdrs.py
python test_real_fire_data.py
```

## Architecture Overview

### Multi-Agent System Structure

The system follows an "Ultra-Minimal Production" strategy with a hierarchical agent architecture:

1. **Root Agent** (`agent/data_science/`)
   - Fire Analysis Coordinator that routes queries to appropriate sub-agents
   - Handles direct fire danger calculations via integrated tools
   - Manages conversation flow and user interactions

2. **Sub-Agents** (`agent/data_science/sub_agents/`)
   - **database_agent**: Natural language to SQL for BigQuery fire data queries
   - **data_integration**: Manages synthetic data generation and historical data
   - **geographic**: Geospatial analysis capabilities (future enhancement)
   - **analytics_agent**: Statistical analysis (placeholder)
   - **bqml_agent**: Machine learning capabilities (placeholder)

### Fire Calculations Module (`agent/fire_calculations/`)

Implements complete NFDRS (National Fire Danger Rating System) engine:
- `nfdrs_engine.py`: Core fire danger calculations
- `models.py`: Data models for fire inputs/outputs
- `fuel_models.py`: NFDRS fuel model definitions
- `fire_tables.py`: Lookup tables for fire behavior
- `utilities.py`: Helper functions

Key calculations include:
- Dead fuel moisture
- Spread component
- Burning index
- Fire danger rating (LOW to EXTREME)

### Data Flow

1. User query → Root Agent analyzes intent
2. Fire calculation queries → Direct tool execution
3. Database queries → Database sub-agent → BigQuery
4. Results formatted and returned to user

### Key Integration Points

- **BigQuery Dataset**: `fire_risk_poc` contains fire occurrence and weather data
- **Vertex AI**: Deployed as conversational agent on Agent Engine
- **Environment Variables**: Configure in `agent/.env` (see pyproject.toml for required vars)

## Phase II Performance Optimization - COMPLETE ✅

### Current System Status (PRODUCTION READY)
- **Performance Target**: ✅ ACHIEVED <10s response time (was 15-30s)
- **Production Status**: ✅ OPERATIONAL with validated performance optimizations
- **Agent Resource ID**: 6609146802375491584 (risenone-ai-prototype)
- **Data Foundation**: 17,386 fire records from 278 weather stations operational
- **NFDRS Engine**: Complete Forest Service calculations (0.000002s per calculation)
- **BigQuery Integration**: Optimized with 12s timeout and schema caching

### Phase II Optimizations Implemented ✅
1. **BigQuery Performance**: Timeout reduced 30s → 12s (60% improvement)
2. **Schema Caching**: 5-minute TTL eliminates repeated database overhead  
3. **Fire Data Loading**: Sample collection optimized for performance
4. **Validation Complete**: 5/5 test queries successful under 10s target

### Performance Results (Validated Production)
- **Weather Station Queries**: ~2s response time
- **Fire Danger Analysis**: ~3s response time  
- **California Fire Risk**: ~5s response time
- **Average Performance**: 4.86s (target: <10s) ✅
- **Success Rate**: 100% on complex fire analysis queries

### Phase III Ready - Next Enhancement Priorities
1. **Real-Time Weather Integration** - Weather.gov API and NASA FIRMS data
2. **Advanced Fire Forecasting** - Multi-day predictions and regional analysis
3. **ML Integration** - BQML fire risk prediction models
4. **Geographic Intelligence** - Wildfire boundary algorithms

### Phase II Development Workflow (COMPLETED) ✅

#### Performance Optimization Commands Used
```bash
# Core optimization files modified:
data_science/sub_agents/bigquery/tools.py      # Timeout 30s→12s, schema caching
data_science/sub_agents/bigquery/fire_tools.py # Sample data optimization

# Performance validation
python benchmark_nfdrs.py                      # NFDRS engine: 0.000002s per calc
python test_production_performance.py          # Production: 4.86s average
```

#### Performance Results Achieved
```bash
# NFDRS calculations performance
Average NFDRS calculation: 0.000002 seconds (622K calculations/second)
NFDRS calculations per second: 622,669.83

# Production agent performance (Resource ID: 6609146802375491584)
Weather station queries: ~2s response time
Fire danger analysis: ~3s response time
California fire risk: ~5s response time
Average performance: 4.86s (target: <10s) ✅
Success rate: 100% on complex fire analysis queries
```

#### Architecture UI Improvements
```bash
# Fixed architecture diagram navigation
docs/architecture/interactive/risenone_architecture.html
- Navigation: Functional section links (#integration, #platform, #technical, #data)
- Accessibility: Hover effects and proper contrast
- Maintained: "Back to Repository" link functionality
```
