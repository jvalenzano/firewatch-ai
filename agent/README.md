# RisenOne Fire Analysis Multi-Agent System

## Overview

This project implements an AI-powered fire risk analysis system designed specifically for Forest Service scientists and fire management personnel. Built on Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), it provides natural language interfaces for complex fire danger calculations, weather analysis, and predictive modeling that traditionally require manual spreadsheet work.

The system integrates with the RisenOne Data Mesh platform to deliver real-time fire risk insights through conversational AI, replacing time-consuming manual processes with instant, intelligent analysis.

## üî• Agent Architecture

| Agent | Role | Capabilities |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **fire_analysis_coordinator** | Root Orchestrator | Manages conversations, routes queries, coordinates multi-agent responses |
| **weather_analysis_agent** | Meteorological Analysis | Weather station data processing, forecast interpretation, atmospheric modeling |
| **fire_risk_agent** | Danger Assessment | Fire danger index calculations, risk scoring, spread probability analysis |
| **ml_prediction_agent** | Predictive Modeling | BigQuery ML fire spread models, crew positioning optimization, resource allocation |

### Key Features

* **Natural Language Fire Queries:** Ask complex questions like "What's the fire risk in Zone 7 tomorrow based on wind forecasts?"
* **Automated Calculations:** Replace manual spreadsheet work with instant AI-driven fire danger computations
* **Real-time Data Integration:** Connects to weather stations, fire detection systems, and field observations
* **Predictive Analytics:** 7-day fire risk forecasting (3-day historical + current + 3-day prediction)
* **Map Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with OpenLayers-based geospatial interface
* **Multi-Zone Analysis:** Supports analysis across multiple Forest Service zones and regions

## üå°Ô∏è Data Sources

The system processes multiple types of fire-related data:

* **Weather Station Data:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed/direction, precipitation from NOAA and local stations
* **Fire Danger Data:** Current fire detection, danger indices, fuel moisture levels, burning index
* **Field Observations:** Scientist-collected vegetation data, soil conditions, fuel loads, ground assessments
* **Satellite Data:** Google Earth Engine integration for vegetation monitoring and large-scale analysis
* **Historical Data:** Fire spread patterns, weather correlations, seasonal trends

## üí¨ Example Interactions

### Fire Risk Assessment
```
üßë‚Äçüî¨ Scientist: "Should we position crews in Zone 7 based on tomorrow's forecast?"

ü§ñ Agent: "Based on tomorrow's forecast for Zone 7:
- Wind speeds: 15-25 mph from SW
- Humidity: 25-35% (CRITICAL)
- Fire danger index: EXTREME (90/100)

Recommended crew positioning:
‚úÖ Station 12 crews at coordinates [47.2, -114.1] 
‚úÖ Pre-position 8 additional crews at Forward Base Alpha
‚ö†Ô∏è High probability fire spread toward populated areas

Expected response time: <8 minutes for 85% of Zone 7"
```

### Weather Pattern Analysis
```
üßë‚Äçüî¨ Scientist: "How do current drought conditions compare to historical fire seasons?"

ü§ñ Agent: "Current drought analysis vs. historical data:
- Soil moisture: 15% below 20-year average
- Precipitation deficit: 2.3 inches since April
- Similar to 2018 and 2003 fire seasons

Risk factors:
üî¥ Extended dry period (45+ days)
üî¥ Fuel moisture content: CRITICAL (8-12%)
üü° Wind patterns: Moderate concern

Historical correlation shows 78% probability of significant fire activity in next 14 days under these conditions."
```

### Predictive Modeling
```
üßë‚Äçüî¨ Scientist: "If we get 15 mph winds from the east, how would fire spread from the Miller Creek area?"

ü§ñ Agent: "Fire spread simulation for Miller Creek with 15 mph easterly winds:

Hour 1-3: 
- Spread rate: 6 chains/hour northeast
- Containment probability: 65% with current resources

Hour 3-6:
- Potential area: 1,200 acres
- Structures at risk: 12 buildings
- Evacuation trigger: Hour 4

Recommended actions:
üö® Deploy air resources immediately
üöÅ Position crews at Highway 200 as fire break
üìû Notify evacuation coordinators for Sunset Valley area"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Multi-Agent Coordination
The system uses Google's Agent Development Kit multi-agent framework where each specialized agent maintains its own session memory while sharing context through the root coordinator.

## üìö For Forest Service Scientists

### Common Fire Analysis Workflows

1. **Morning Briefing Preparation:**
   - "Summarize overnight fire activity and today's risk forecast"
   - "Which zones need priority attention based on weather conditions?"

2. **Resource Allocation:**
   - "Optimize crew positioning for maximum coverage in high-risk areas"
   - "Calculate response times for current crew deployment"

3. **Incident Response:**
   - "Model fire spread scenarios for the Blackfoot Fire"
   - "Identify evacuation trigger points and timing"

4. **Long-term Planning:**
   - "Analyze seasonal fire patterns for budget planning"
   - "Identify areas needing fuel reduction based on risk modeling"

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors:** Ensure `gcloud auth application-default login` is completed
* **Data Access Issues:** Verify BigQuery permissions and dataset existence
* **Agent Coordination Problems:** Check session state and agent model configurations
* **Weather Data Delays:** Confirm API keys and data source connectivity

### Support Resources

* Check logs at `/logs/agent_activity.log`
* Test individual agents: `adk run data_science --agent=weather_analysis_agent`
* Validate data connections: `python scripts/test_data_sources.py`

## üö® Production Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is a prototype system for Forest Service evaluation.**

For production deployment:
- Implement comprehensive error handling for critical fire situations
- Add redundant data sources and failover mechanisms  
- Establish audit logging for all fire-related decisions and recommendations
- Include data validation and quality checks for safety-critical outputs
- Implement role-based access controls for different user types
