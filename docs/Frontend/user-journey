# User Stories and Journey Maps

This document outlines the user stories, journey maps, and a wireframe for the RisenOne Fire Risk AI Proof of Concept (POC). It serves as a unified communication tool for the team, aligning the user journey with the technical vision for the front-end layer. The focus is on the three demonstration scenarios, ensuring stakeholders see the value proposition and technical feasibility. Let’s break it down.

## Scenario 1: "Current Fire Danger Assessment"

**User Story:**

As a Forest Service Scientist, I want to quickly assess the current fire danger in a specific zone (e.g., Zone 7) so that I can make immediate crew positioning decisions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* User enters "What’s the current fire danger in Zone 7?" via the Chat Interface.
* System responds within 15 seconds with a Burning Index (e.g., 85 - EXTREME) and a heatmap overlay on the Map Interface.
* Chat provides a natural language explanation and crew recommendations.
* Map highlights risk distribution with clickable zones for detail.

**Journey Map:**

* **Phase 1: Trigger (0-2 sec)**
    * **Action:** User opens the app and types query in Chat Interface.
    * **Emotion:** Curious, focused.
    * **Touchpoint:** Chat Interface displays input field and loading spinner.
* **Phase 2: Processing (2-15 sec)**
    * **Action:** Root Coordinator routes query to Weather Analysis and Fire Risk Agents; Map Interface shows progress.
    * **Emotion:** Anticipatory.
    * **Touchpoint:** Loading indicator updates; Weather.gov API data fetched.
* **Phase 3: Response (15 sec)**
    * **Action:** Map displays heatmap; Chat shows "Burning Index: 85 (EXTREME)" and "Position crews near high-risk areas."
    * **Emotion:** Satisfied, relieved.

    * **Action:** User clicks heatmap zone for details or asks follow-up question.
    * **Emotion:** Engaged.
    * **Touchpoint:** Detailed tooltip or new chat response.

## Scenario 2: "Multi-Day Predictive Analysis"

**User Story:**

As a Forest Service Scientist, I want to predict fire risk over the next 5 days under specific conditions (e.g., no rain) so that I can plan proactive measures.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* User inputs "How will fire risk change over the next 5 days if no rain falls?" via Chat Interface.
* System responds within 25 seconds with a temporal heatmap progression (Day 1: HIGH to Day 5: EXTREME) on the Map Interface.
* Chat provides daily risk levels and pre-positioning recommendations by Day 3.
* “What-if” slider allows condition adjustments.

**Journey Map:**

* **Phase 1: Trigger (0-2 sec)**
    * **Action:** User selects “What-if” scenario and inputs query.
    * **Emotion:** Strategic, inquisitive.
    * **Touchpoint:** Chat Interface with slider and input field.
* **Phase 2: Processing (2-25 sec)**
    * **Action:** Agents process 5-day forecast; Map Interface animates progress.
    * **Emotion:** Patient.
    * **Touchpoint:** Loading bar and forecast data integration.
* **Phase 3: Response (25 sec)**
    * **Action:** Map shows day-by-day heatmap; Chat displays "Day 1: HIGH → Day 5: EXTREME" and "Pre-position by Day 3."
    * **Emotion:** Impressed, decisive.
    * **Touchpoint:** Animated map and detailed chat narrative.
* **Phase 4: Follow-Up (25+ sec)**
    * **Action:** User adjusts slider or requests region-specific details.
    * **Emotion:** Curious.
    * **Touchpoint:** Updated map and chat response.

## Scenario 3: "Complex Multi-Region Analysis"

**User Story:**

As a Forest Service Scientist, I want to analyze fire risk across multiple regions (e.g., Southern California and Northern Rockies) so that I can assess new ignition risks affecting Zone 7.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
* User inputs "With active fires in Southern California and current conditions in Northern Rockies, what’s the risk of new ignitions affecting Zone 7?" via Chat Interface.
* System responds within 30 seconds with a multi-region heatmap on the Map Interface.
* Chat provides a detailed risk assessment and strategic insights.
* Map supports region-specific overlays.

**Journey Map:**

* **Phase 1: Trigger (0-2 sec)**
    * **Action:** User enters complex query in Chat Interface.
    * **Emotion:** Analytical, hopeful.
    * **Touchpoint:** Chat input field and map reset.
* **Phase 2: Processing (2-30 sec)**
    * **Action:** Agents correlate synthetic and real data; Map Interface indicates multi-region analysis.
    * **Emotion:** Engaged.
    * **Touchpoint:** Progress indicator and data synthesis.
* **Phase 3: Response (30 sec)**
    * **Action:** Map shows multi-region overlay; Chat delivers "Risk assessment: Moderate in Zone 7 due to Southern California fires."
    * **Emotion:** Confident, informed.
    * **Touchpoint:** Detailed map and comprehensive chat response.
* **Phase 4: Follow-Up (30+ sec)**
    * **Action:** User explores specific regions or asks for mitigation strategies.
    * **Emotion:** Proactive.
    * **Touchpoint:** Interactive map zones and chat dialogue.

## Wireframe Description

Below is a textual representation of the wireframe, showing the Map Interface interacting with the Chat Interface. Imagine a split-screen layout optimized for desktop and mobile views.

```

* **Layout:** The screen is divided vertically. The left side hosts the Map Interface with a heatmap (e.g., Zone 7 in red for EXTREME risk), a tooltip for zone details, and a “What-if” slider for scenario adjustments. The right side features the Chat Interface with an input text box, send button, and a response area displaying agent-generated text.
* **Interaction:** Typing a query (e.g., "What’s the current fire danger?") in the Chat Interface triggers a loading spinner. The Map Interface updates with a heatmap, and the Chat Interface fills with the response. Clicking a map zone opens a tooltip, syncing with chat for detailed data.
* **Responsiveness:** On mobile, the layout stacks vertically, with the Map Interface above the Chat Interface, ensuring touch-friendly controls.
* This wireframe, built with React and AG-UI as suggested, will be prototyped using Figma or Adobe XD for the Week 1 demo (June 9-13, 2025).
