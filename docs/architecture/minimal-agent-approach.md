## Fire Domain Specific Considerations

### Current Manual Workflows (To Be Automated)

**Scientists currently spend hours on:**
1. **Weather Data Collection** - Download from multiple RAWS stations
2. **Fire Danger Calculations** - Manual spreadsheet formulas for danger indices
3. **Risk Assessment** - Probability calculations for fire spread
4. **Crew Positioning** - Resource allocation optimization
5. **7-Day Forecasting** - Historical + current + 3-day predictions

### Target AI Workflow

**Scientists will ask natural language questions:**
- *"What's the fire risk in Zone 7 for the next 3 days?"*
- *"Should we position crews based on tomorrow's forecast?"*
- *"Compare current conditions to the 2019 fire season"*
- *"Generate evacuation recommendations for high-risk areas"*

### Domain-Specific Tools Evolution

```python
# Phase 1: No tools (conversational guidance only)
tools = []

# Phase 2: Core fire calculations
tools = [
    fire_danger_calculator,    # NFDRS, Haines Index, KBDI
    risk_assessment_tool,      # Probability mapping
]

# Phase 3: Complete automation
tools = [
    fire_danger_calculator,
    risk_assessment_tool,
    weather_data_fetcher,      # RAWS, NOAA integration
    crew_optimizer,            # Resource allocation
    map_generator,             # GeoJSON overlays
    alert_system,              # Risk notifications
]
```

---

## Production Deployment Strategy

### Vertex AI Agent Engine Deployment

**Configuration for Production:**

```python
from vertexai.preview.reasoning_engines import AdkApp
from vertexai import agent_engines

# Wrap agent for deployment
app = AdkApp(
    agent=fire_analysis_agent,
    enable_tracing=True,          # For debugging
    session_service_builder=None, # Use managed sessions
)

# Deploy to production
remote_agent = agent_engines.create(
    app,
    requirements=[
        "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]>=1.0.0",
        "google-cloud-bigquery>=3.0.0",
        "google-adk>=1.0.0",
    ],
    display_name="RisenOne Fire Analysis Agent",
    description="AI assistant for Forest Service wildfire risk analysis",
    env_vars={
        "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT": "risenone-ai-prototype",
        "GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI": "1",
    },
)
```

**Best Practices:**
- 📦 **Pin Dependencies** - Avoid breaking changes
- 🔒 **Use Managed Sessions** - Let Agent Engine handle state
- 📊 **Enable Tracing** - For production debugging
- ⚡ **Minimize Requirements** - Faster deployment, fewer conflicts

### Deployment Checklist

**Pre-Deployment:**
- [ ] Test locally with `adk web`
- [ ] Validate all environment variables
- [ ] Test fire domain queries
- [ ] Verify BigQuery permissions
- [ ] Check ADK version compatibility

**Post-Deployment:**
- [ ] Verify agent engine status
- [ ] Test production endpoints
- [ ] Monitor session management
- [ ] Validate fire analysis responses
- [ ] Check performance metrics

## Error Handling Strategy

### Common Production Issues

**Issue:** Agent fails to start in Vertex AI Agent Engine
```python
# Solution: Simplify dependencies
requirements = [
    "google-cloud-aiplatform[adk,agent_engines]>=1.0.0",
    # Remove: complex ML libraries that may conflict
    # Add: only essential fire analysis dependencies
]
```

**Issue:** Sub-agent communication failures
```python
# Solution: Direct tool approach instead of sub-agent wrappers
# Good: Direct sub-agent usage
sub_agents = [weather_agent]

# Avoid: Complex tool wrappers around sub-agents  
# tools = [call_weather_agent_wrapper]  # More failure points
```

**Issue:** Session state management errors
```python
# Solution: Use managed sessions, avoid custom state
# Good: Let Agent Engine handle sessions
app = AdkApp(agent=agent)  # Uses managed sessions

# Avoid: Custom session management
# app = AdkApp(agent=agent, session_service_builder=custom_db)
```

### Recovery Procedures

**Deployment Failure:**
1. Check agent engine logs in Cloud Console
2. Validate requirements.txt syntax
3. Test locally with identical environment
4. Rollback to last working configuration
5. Deploy minimal version, add features incrementally

**Runtime Errors:**
1. Enable tracing in production
2. Check session state consistency  
3. Validate input parameters
4. Test individual sub-agents in isolation
5. Monitor BigQuery query performance

---

## Testing Strategy

### Local Development Testing

```bash
# Basic functionality test
cd agent/
adk web

# Test fire analysis queries
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What'\''s the fire risk in Zone 7?"}'
```

### Production Validation

```python
# Automated production testing
def test_production_agent():
    session = remote_agent.create_session(user_id="test_scientist")
    
    # Test core fire analysis capability
    response = remote_agent.stream_query(
        user_id="test_scientist",
        session_id=session["id"],
        message="Analyze fire risk for northern Montana"
    )
    
    assert "fire risk" in response.lower()
    assert "montana" in response.lower()
```

### Fire Domain Test Cases

**Basic Queries:**
- "What's the current fire danger level?"
- "Explain the Haines Index calculation"
- "What weather factors increase fire risk?"

**Advanced Queries (Phase 2+):**
- "Calculate fire danger for Zone 7 tomorrow"
- "Compare current vs historical fire risk"
- "Recommend crew positioning for maximum coverage"

**Complex Scenarios (Phase 3):**
- "Generate evacuation plan for high-risk areas"
- "Model fire spread with 20% wind increase"
- "Optimize resource allocation across 3 zones"
