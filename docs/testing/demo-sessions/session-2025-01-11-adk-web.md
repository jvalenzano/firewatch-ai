- **Response**: "The fire danger is MODERATE based on the provided weather conditions."
- **Result**: âœ… PASS
- **Notes**: Excellent NFDRS implementation with detailed breakdown: Dead FM: 1.0%, Live FM: 120.0%, SC: 4.2, ERC: 63.3, BI: 26.5, Classification: MODERATE. Fastest response at ~1.3 seconds.

### **Scenario 5: Multi-Station Comparison**
- **Query**: "Show me the latest fire danger data" (covered multiple stations)
- **Response**: Successfully provided data for multiple stations including BROOKS, ALDER SPRINGS, APPLE VALLEY 2, BELMONT, BLACK HILLS, etc.
- **Result**: âœ… PASS
- **Notes**: Demonstrated multi-station capability through latest data query. Showed varying fire danger levels across different geographic locations and fuel models.

### **Scenario 6: Fire Science Explanation**
- **Query**: "Explain how NFDRS fire danger calculations work"
- **Response**: "The National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) uses a combination of weather, fuel, and topographic factors to estimate fire danger. Here's a simplified overview: 1. Weather Data: Key inputs include temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and precipitation... [comprehensive explanation of IC, SC, ERC, BI components and fire danger rating system]"
- **Result**: âœ… PASS
- **Notes**: Comprehensive educational response covering all major NFDRS components. Technically accurate with appropriate detail level. Response time ~1.5 seconds.
