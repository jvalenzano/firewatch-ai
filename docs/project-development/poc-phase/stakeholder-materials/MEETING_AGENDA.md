# න්‍ Client Meeting Agenda: RisenOne Fire Risk AI

**Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Objective:** Align on current project status, address implementation gaps, and define a clear path forward.

---

### **1. Opening & Project Vision Recap (5 mins)**

*   **Welcome & Introductions**
*   **Reiteration of Project Goal:** To build a sophisticated, AI-powered agent that revolutionizes fire risk analysis by replacing manual, time-consuming processes with instant, intelligent insights.
*   **Acknowledge Foundational Success:** The core infrastructure (GCP, BigQuery, ADK Web API) is operational and robust, providing a solid platform for development.

---

### **2. Current Status & Implementation Reality Check (10 mins)**

*   **Transparency First:** A recent systematic, hands-on testing phase has revealed a significant discrepancy between our documentation and the agent's current functional capabilities.
*   **High-Level Findings:**
    *   **What Works:** The basic conversational agent and underlying technical infrastructure are functioning correctly.
    *   **What Doesn't:** The core fire science capabilities—data retrieval, risk calculation, and predictive analysis—are not yet implemented. The agent currently cannot perform its primary mission.
*   **Key Blocker Identified:** The root cause is a breakdown in communication between the main agent and the specialized `database_agent`. This prevents access to all fire and weather data, blocking all other features.

### **3. Revised POC Status & Corrected Assessments (10 mins)**

*   **Objective:** Provide an honest, accurate assessment of our Proof-of-Concept features based on live testing.

| Feature Area (POC Issue) | Previous Status | **Actual Status (Post-Testing)** |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Specialized Fire Agents** (AD-2) | Believed Complete | **Needs Major Work** (Data connection broken) |
| **NFDRS Calculations** (AD-3) | Known Gaps | **Not Implemented** (Requires full build-out) |
| **Interactive UI** (AD-4) | Known Gaps | **Not Implemented** (Agent has no UI capabilities) |
| **Advanced Demo Features** (AD-5) | Believed Complete | **Not Functional** (Core features absent) |

### **4. Our Action Plan: A Clear Path Forward (10 mins)**

*   We have a clear, prioritized plan to address these gaps and build the required functionality on our solid infrastructure.

*   **Priority #1: Fix the Foundation (IMMEDIATE FOCUS)**
    1.  **Debug & Repair Agent Communication:** Resolve the `database_agent` transfer failure.
    2.  **Enable Basic Data Queries:** Ensure the agent can reliably retrieve weather and fire data from BigQuery.
    3.  **Goal:** Achieve a stable agent that can answer simple, data-driven questions.

*   **Priority #2: Implement Core Fire Science Engine**
    1.  Build and integrate the NFDRS calculation engine.
    2.  Implement fuel moisture, spread component, and burning index calculations.

*   **Priority #3: Develop Advanced Capabilities & UI**
    1.  Build the interactive user interface.
    2.  Implement predictive and multi-region analysis features.

### **5. Open Discussion & Next Steps (5 mins)**

*   **Commitment to Transparency:** We are committed to providing regular, accurate updates on our progress against this revised plan.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Focus entirely on completing **Priority #1**.
    *   Provide a revised project timeline once the foundational data connection is stable.
*   **Q&A Session**
