## POC Technical Architecture Overview

The POC employs a simplified single-container architecture that demonstrates all core capabilities while minimizing infrastructure complexity. This approach allows stakeholders to experience the full value proposition without the overhead of production-scale deployment.

### High-Level Architecture

The architecture shows the streamlined approach where all components run within a single Cloud Run container, connected to real external APIs while using synthetic data where needed for demonstration purposes.

### Detailed Container Architecture

This detailed view illustrates the complete internal structure of the POC container, showing how the Streamlit frontend, Vertex AI multi-agent system, in-memory data layer, and fire calculation engine work together to deliver the complete fire risk analysis experience.

## Data Strategy
