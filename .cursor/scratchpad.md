# RisenOne Fire Risk AI POC - HTML Demonstration

## Background and Motivation

**Project Goal:** Create a single HTML file demonstration of the RisenOne Fire Risk AI Proof of Concept front-end interface based on the design specifications and user journey documents.

**Key Requirements:**
- Single HTML file with three interactive scenarios
- Capture the user journey and functionality outlined in both documents:
  1. Current Fire Danger Assessment (15-second response)
  2. Multi-Day Predictive Analysis (25-second response)
  3. Complex Multi-Region Analysis (30-second response)
- Split-screen design with Map Interface (left, 60%) and Chat Interface (right, 40%)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile (stacked layout)
- Focus on visual design communication for front-end developers
- Demonstration of functionality rather than detailed mapping accuracy

**Target Audience:** Front-end developers to understand the visual design and feature requirements

**User Journey Focus:** 
- Phase-based interactions (Trigger → Processing → Response → Follow-Up)
- Emotional journey mapping (Curious → Anticipatory → Satisfied → Engaged)
- Progressive complexity across scenarios

## Key Challenges and Analysis

**Technical Challenges:**
1. **Single HTML File Constraint:** Need to embed all CSS, JavaScript, and simulate the map functionality without external dependencies where possible
2. **Map Visualization:** Need to create convincing fire risk heatmap overlays without full GIS integration
3. **Interactive Scenarios:** Simulate the three different user journeys with realistic timing and responses
4. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the split-screen layout works on both desktop and mobile
5. **Animation/Loading States:** Implement realistic loading spinners and progressive data display

**Design Considerations:**
1. **Color Palette Implementation:** Blue (#1E90FF), green (#32CD32), red (#FF4500), orange (#FFA500), yellow (#FFFF00), light gray (#F5F5F5)
2. **Typography:** Roboto font, various sizes (12px tooltips, 14px input, 16px body, 20px headers)
3. **Interactive Elements:** What-if sliders, toggle switches, clickable zones, tooltips
4. **Loading States:** 15-30 second simulated processing times with progress indicators

## POC Kickoff - Updated Strategy Based on Implementation Plan

**Comprehensive POC Structure Identified:** 13 issues across 4 phases, 10-day timeline, with detailed dependencies

### Updated Recommendation: Immediate POC Branch Setup
**Priority:** Start with the Discovery & Architecture phase foundation

### Phase 1: Immediate Setup (NOW)
1. **Create POC workspace:** `poc/main` branch - base for all 13 POC issues
2. **Create POC tracking document:** `.cursor/poc-scratchpad.md` linked to the 13-issue matrix
3. **Ready first feature branches:** `poc/da-1-gcp-setup`, `poc/da-2-geographic-data`

### Alignment with POC Implementation Plan:
- ✅ **13 GitHub Issues:** Already created (#23-#35)
- ✅ **4-Phase Structure:** Discovery & Architecture → Agent Development → Testing & Validation → Governance & Deployment
- ✅ **10-Day Timeline:** Week 1 (Foundation) → Week 2 (Integration & Demo)
- ✅ **Branch Strategy:** Matches exactly: `poc/main` + `poc/da-1-gcp-setup`, etc.

### Critical Dependencies Identified:
- **POC-DA-1** (Day 1): Blocks all subsequent development - needs immediate attention
- **POC-DA-2** (Day 2): Foundation for map visualization (already have demo HTML)
- **Demo Integration:** Our existing demo aligns with POC-AD-4 (Streamlit Frontend)

**Ready to Execute POC Branch Structure:** This will set up the foundation for the structured 13-issue development plan.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Questions for Clarification:**

1. **File Location:** Where would you like the HTML demo file to be created? (e.g., in a `demo/` folder, in the `docs/Frontend/` directory, or at the root level?)

2. **Map Data:** Should I create a simplified SVG representation of the US map, or would you prefer I use a more sophisticated approach? The design calls for "high-resolution U.S. map with state boundaries" - for a demo, would a stylized version be acceptable?

3. **Scenario Navigation:** How should users switch between the three scenarios? Should there be:
   - Tab navigation at the top?
   - Dropdown selector?
   - Separate pages with navigation buttons?
   - All scenarios accessible from a single interface?

4. **Data Simulation:** For the demonstration, should the responses be:
   - Completely pre-scripted based on specific queries?
   - Semi-dynamic with random variations?
   - Should there be multiple example queries for each scenario?

5. **External Dependencies:** Are you okay with using a few external CDN resources (like Leaflet for maps, or should everything be completely self-contained? The design mentions Leaflet with React-Leaflet, but for a demo we could use simpler approaches.

6. **Timing Realism:** Should the loading times (15-30 seconds) be realistically implemented, or would shorter demo-friendly times (3-5 seconds) be better for presentation purposes?
